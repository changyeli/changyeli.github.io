I'm Changye Li, a Ph.D. candidate of the [Institute for Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/), [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). My research interests include developing NLP applications with behavioral and biomedical data. I'm particularly interested in the  **explainability** of NLP applications with biomedical/clinical and behavior data. I am very lucky to be advised by Professor [Serguei Pakhomov](https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/bio/institute-of-personalized-medi/serguei-pakhomov).

I'm on job market this year! I'm looking for post-doc and tenure track positions!
